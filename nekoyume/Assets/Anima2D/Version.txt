- Project view and inspector SpriteMesh previews.
- Improved scene bone selection.
- Rotating the bone by dragging now works on bones with negative scale.
- Bone highlight will show vanishing child bones.
- Added bone alpha color slider.
- SpriteMeshInstance: should use Sprite dedicated materials.
- SpriteMeshInstance: color tint.

v1.0.2 2015-12-20
- SpriteMesh Editor: Additive vertex selection using control button was not working on windows.
- Create SpriteMesh: works on selected textures in the Project View.
- PoseManager: now checks and shows invalid duplicate bone paths.
- PoseManager: Load pose will set the position of the attached IKs.
- Visible and Locked Layers now work as expected in bones.
- SpriteMeshInstanceEditor: added warning messages when bone list is not valid for skinning.
- Scene GUI: Highlight the current hovered bone.

- Fix: SpriteMeshInstace "Set skinned renderer" button now sets the "root bone" property.
- Fix: Several Undo related bugs:
  Undo breaking bone chain by unparenting transforms was not recovering the child bone reference.
  Undo bone hierarchy deletion was causing problems in SpriteMesh Editor, IK components and SpriteMeshInstances.
- Fix: nullref exceptions when undoing bone hierarchy deletion.
- Fix: Created SpriteMeshes could have a small offset compared to the original Sprite.
- Fix: You can now scale bones attached to a LimbIK.
- Fix: IKs do not update on scene pan/orbit/FPS mouse drag anymore.
  That introduced unwanted keyframes in animation mode.

v1.0 2015-10
- Release! All your 2D base are belong to us.
