Version 2.10.0
December 19, 2016

    Made the ScrollSize property public


Version 2.9.3
December 16, 2016

Version 2.9.2
July 29, 2016

    Fixed description in Demo 8 View Driven Cell Sizes to accurately describe the new process of calculating the cell size based on the view contents


Version 2.9.1

Version 2.9.0
May 19, 2016

    Added cellViewWillRecycle callback which is called just before the cell view is recycled. This will allow you to clean up or get the properties of the cell just before it disappears.

Version 2.6.2
February 02, 2016

    Fixed division by zero bug in snapping when cell count is zero


Version 2.6.1
November 06, 2015

    Added Snap function to the EnhancedScroller class. This will allow you to snap your scroller using the snap settings even if the scroller is not moving.
    Fixed the tweening to stop at the end position after the time has expired. This will get the scroller to the exact location specified, no matter how quickly the tween occurred.
    Improved the View Driven Cell Size example to refresh in two frames instead of three.


Version 2.6.0
November 05, 2015

    Added demo #8 to show how to dynamically calculate cell sizes based on content in the cell views
    Added demo #9 to show how to respond to events in the cell views


Version 2.5.0
October 29, 2015

    Added a virtual method RefreshCellView to the EnhancedScrollerCellView class. This method is called by the RefreshActiveCellViews method of the scroller.
    Added RefreshActiveCellViews method to the EnhancedScroller class. This will call RefreshCellView on each active cell visible in the scroller.
    Added Demo 7 : Refreshing for an example of how to use the above additions


Version 2.4.0
October 28, 2015

    Added delegates for scroll state (scrollerScrollingChanged) and tween state (scrollerTweeningChanged) changes
    Added properties that tell if the scroller is scrolling (IsScrolling) or tweening (IsTweening)
    Updated the documentation

    Changed the tweening to use unscaledDeltaTime instead of deltaTime so that the tweening can continue even when the game's timescale is set to zero (paused)
    Added ClearRecycled function to the EnhancedScroller script to allow you to delete all the recycled objects. This is useful if you will be loading an entirely different set of cell views and don't want the old cell views to stick around. Note that this new function does call garbage collection.


Version 2.3.3
October 12, 2015

    Fixed the DivideByZeroException when loading in zero data rows


Version 2.3.2
October 12, 2015

    Fixed "popping" effect when scrolling with the scrollbar. Refresh will now happen immediately instead of in the LateUpdate


Version 2.3.1
August 23, 2015

    Updated user manual to reflect tweening changes


Version 2.3.0
August 23, 2015

    Added tweening to the jump and snapping functions. You can now set easing for these methods, or just set them to immediate to make the process happen without any easing.

August 21, 2015

    Fixed the missing "Credits" label in the Demo 6


Version 2.2.0
August 21, 2015

    Exposed more properties and methods of the EnhancedScroller class.
    Added a snapping demo that shows how snapping can be used in a slot machine game
    Created a user manual for explanation of the different features of the plugin

    Fixed spelling of method JumpToDataIndex in the EnhancedScroller.cs script.

Version 2.0
July 30, 2015

Big changes in this release. Note: if you have already deeply integrated the 1.x scroller in your project, it might be better to hold off on upgrading until you start a new project. The new scroller is a lot less connected to the data and cell views, so there will be significant changes to your code if you are upgrading.

    The scroller no longer requires the data to be passed to it. It is completely unaware of the underlying data, instead relying on a delegate script to give it the information it needs. You no longer have to have your list as a set of objects. This allows a more flexible model and better separation of concerns for a true MVC solution. The delegate provides the cell sizes, the number of cells, and the cell view to display for a given data index.
    Setup of the scroller in the scene is much simpler now. You don't need to worry about anchors and pivots as much. You also don't need to set up much on the Scroll Rect component as that is handled automatically for you at scene start.
    The scroller can handle more than one type of cell prefab. The scroller will recycle the correct type as long as your cell identifiers are unique.
    Cell spacing and scroller padding have been added.
    More robust SmallList class that can be used in your project on things other than just the scroller. The SmallList is memory friendly, not releasing memory to the garbage collector.
    Three new demos to get your creative ideas flowing.
    Internal improvements to memory usage and speed, as well as some bug fixes from 1.x.


Version 1.2
June 03, 2015

    Added Demo 7 to show how images and selection can be incorporated
